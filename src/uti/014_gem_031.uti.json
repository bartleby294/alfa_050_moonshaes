It is also used as a good luck charm by horsemen who would put a small shard of turquoise in their horse's harness to ward off misstep or trail hazards. Turquoise has a slight gleam when it comes near gold and was therefore associated with prosperity. Foredawn was the best time of day to apply an immersion containing turquoise.\n"
