Once \"cooked,\" the color change is permanent and does not otherwise affect the much-treasured durability of the gem.\nLORE:\nit is commonly believed that the power of wisdom is contained within this precious gemstone. They believed that when the wearer of a blue sapphire faces challenging obstacles, the stone's power enables them to find the correct solution.\nMarriage partners often had great faith in Sapphire. If its luster dimmed, one knew their spouse had been unfaithful. Sapphire refused to shine when worn by the wicked or impure. \nSapphires are believed to attract divine favor to their owners. A gem could preserve its wearer from envy, protect against captivity, and serve as a key to understanding the oracles. Sapphire was considered to be so powerful that it protected the original owner even after being sold"
