What is known is the Foehammer journeyed across four famous battlefields, using or creating a circular chain of one-way portals, and leaving a trail of red tears behind him to mark the path he took. If they were real gems, they have long since been collected or stolen. What remained behind were actually illusions of Tempus's weepings, only visible to those who successfully met the challenges at each stop along the trail."
