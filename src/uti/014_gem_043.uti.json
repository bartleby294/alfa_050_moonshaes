Both types were hard, easily cleaved, durable, and produced beautiful large faceted gems. The color of the kunzite variety unfortunately faded with time and because of this was called \"ghost stone\". \n\nIf this stone was sprinkled with holy water (at least three drops) it had the ability to open wizard locked doors and items on contact. The gemstone was not consumed by this, but the holy water was used up the spodumene had to be anointed for each attempt."
