Any creature in that area that fails a DC 14 will save becomes catatonic for 1d4+4 rounds. Any creature that successfuly saves will be unaffected again by that meenlocks fear aura for 24 hours.\n\nParalysis (Ex): Any creature hit by a Meenlock's claw attack must make a fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. \n\n\nRend Mind (Su): A meenlock can project thoughts and suggestions into the mind of a single creature within 300'. The target of this mind-affecting phantasm must make a DC 14 will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. A meenlock can only use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. \n\n\nDimension Door (Su): Once every 2 rounds, a Meenlock can produce an effect like a dimension door spell, except limited to a range of 60' and no additional weight can be carried. \n\n\nTelepathy (Ex): A meenlock can communicate (usually only malevolently) with any creature within 300' using telepathy. \n\n\n"
