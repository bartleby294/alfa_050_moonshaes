Ravenar was commonly used for inlay work on weapons and accouterments.\n\nRavenar, like all tourmalines, could absorb any spell cast upon it and immediately convert it into three lightning bolts that blasted outward in straight lines from the crystal facets in directions chosen by the caster. This act consumed the gem in the process\n\nRavenars were considered prized gems among the drow. Their lesser deity Vhaeraun was known to occasionally send ravenars to show his favour or disfavour to his followers."
